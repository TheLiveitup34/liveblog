Somethings I have done include:\nBuilt a custom website framework in vanilla PHP and one in JavaScript.\nBuilt a desktop application to view and see chat externally from Minecraft in a live feed.\nWorked with APIs from various providers to build custom applications.\nIntegrated OAuth2 into a custom application to allow users to login with their Twitch account.\nBuilt integrations with Stripe to handle payments and use the information for custom Alerts for livestream Donations.\nBuilt a custom Plugin for a Minecraft server to allow features for fantasy like characteristics and abilities.\nBuilt a few games in PHP and JavaScript using SSE and WebSockets to allow for real time interactions.\nConverted a AI Agent built by a popular streamer to allow conversions and Removed the need for a custom plugin for OBS and rendered the animation in a browser window based on the audio generated.\nSo I have done a bit and I am looking forward to learning more and sharing updates to problems I have created and solved. I also will be sharing updates about how website development for theliveitup34.com my main website. As well as I will be posting my reviews about games, movies, and tv series I find interesting. This is something I just want to do for fun and give some way for my followers on social media to keep up to date!\nAs a note for anyone willing to learn or understand some topics I will be posting about may get technical and I will try to break down the problem in a understandable way and provide examples of how I solved the problem and what happened. I will provied images and diagrams to help explain the problem and solution.\n","date":"2025-04-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.theliveitup34.com/p/hello-world/cover_hu_fe0780cbe0c564c5.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.theliveitup34.com/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
