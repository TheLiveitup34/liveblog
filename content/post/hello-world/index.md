# Hello World
So you may be reading this and thinking, "Who are you?" or "Why are you starting a blog?", or "What is this blog about?"

Well, let me tell you a little bit about myself and what you can expect from this blog.

I am a self taught software developer and I have been building websites and web applications for a few years now. I have learned how to build and deploy websites in a variety of languages and frameworks and have worked with multiple hosting providers. Somethings I have done include:

- Built a custom website framework in vanilla PHP and one in JavaScript.

- Built a desktop application to view and see chat externally from Minecraft in a live feed.

- Worked with APIs from various providers to build custom applications.

- Integrated OAuth2 into a custom application to allow users to login with their Twitch account.

- Built integrations with Stripe to handle payments and use the information for custom Alerts for livestream Donations.

- Built a custom Plugin for a Minecraft server to allow features for fantasy like characteristics and abilities.

- Built a few games in PHP and JavaScript using SSE and WebSockets to allow for real time interactions.

- Converted a AI Agent built by a popular [streamer](https://twitch.tv/dougdoug) to allow conversions and Removed the need for a custom plugin for OBS and rendered the animation in a browser window based on the audio generated.

  

So I have done a bit and I am looking forward to learning more and sharing updates to problems I have created and solved. I also will be sharing updates about how website development for [theliveitup34.com](https://www.theliveitup34.com) my main website. As well as I will be posting my reviews about games, movies, and tv series I find interesting. This is something I just want to do for fun and give some way for my followers on social media to keep up to date!

  

As a note for anyone willing to learn or understand some topics I will be posting about may get technical and I will try to break down the problem in a understandable way and provide examples of how I solved the problem and what happened. I will provied images and diagrams to help explain the problem and solution.
